# Welcome to the ROS Playground [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cyrillg/ros-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cyrillg/ros-playground)

This repository contains the source code for a simulated mobile robot using the
ROS middleware. It is primarily meant to be used in parallel to the educational
website [Serial Robotics](https://serial-robotics.org/) ( /!\ not ready
yet /!\ ).

The goal is to experiment on topics like control, localization, path planning,
all code being made available here, and explained on the website.

Both are still in their (very) early phases but start to take shape, so stay
tuned. For any inquiry, you can contact me through the website.
